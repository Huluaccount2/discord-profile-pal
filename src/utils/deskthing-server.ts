// This file demonstrates the server-side structure for DeskThing
// Note: This would typically be in a separate Node.js environment
// but included here for reference and potential future server integration

// Server-side event handlers would look like this in actual DeskThing server environment:
// DeskThing.on('start', startup);
// DeskThing.on('stop', stop);

const startup = () => {
  console.log('Server: Starting Up');
};

const stop = () => {
  console.log('Server: Stopping app');
};

// Handle client messages on server side
const handleSampleType = (data: any) => {
  console.log('Server received:', data.payload); // prints 'Hello from the client!'
};

// Send data to client from server
const sendToClient = () => {
  // In actual DeskThing server environment, this would be:
  // DeskThing.send({ 
  //   type: 'sampleType', 
  //   payload: 'Hello from the server!' 
  // });
  console.log('Server: Sending to client - Hello from the server!');
};

// Export for potential server integration
export const deskthingServer = {
  startup,
  stop,
  sendToClient,
  handleSampleType
};

// This file serves as documentation for the server-side structure
// In the actual DeskThing environment, the server code would be separate
